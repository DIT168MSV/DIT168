## Purpose of this folder

This repository contains only source files that are used __exclusively__ for the demonstration in the lecture session on Fri. 2 Mar. 2018.

The codes and scripts could (and should) be compiled and run without dependency of current opendlv.scaledcars repository. Only the Docker image **"seresearch/2018-dit-168:v0.3.5-armhf"** is required, as it provides proxy "opendlv-proxy-miniature-pwm-motor" as well as the odsupercomponent. This image is maintained by Federico Giaimo and the version v0.3.5-armhf is uploaded to Docker cloud on Thu. 1 Mar.

This repository is a temporary one, and __could be removed at any time__ after the supposed usage (the demonstration in the lecture session on Fri. 2 Mar. 2018). The owner of this repository __could not__ guarantee long-term maintenance and support.
